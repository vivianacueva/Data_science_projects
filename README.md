Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of my data science projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

[1. An√°lisis de eventos y Test A/A/B para una empresa emergente que vende productos alimenticios](https://github.com/vivianacueva/Data_science_projects/blob/main/Proyecto10_aprobado.ipynb)
- Description: The project has 2 objectives:
    1. To analyze how many users reach the purchasing stage.
    2. The design team would like to change the fonts across the entire application, but management is concerned that users might find the new design intimidating. Therefore, the objective of this stage is to make a decision based on the results of the A/A/B test. The goal is to determine which set of fonts yields the best results. 
- Technologies Used: EDA and A/B Testing Analysis
- Results: 
  1. 47.7% of users complete the entire journey from the first event to the payment.
  2. The experiment results indicate that there is no significant difference in conversion rates between users who experienced the font change and those who did not. Therefore, it is preferable to maintain the current font design of the application and explore other methods to increase conversion.
